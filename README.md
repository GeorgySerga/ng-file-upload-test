# ng-file-upload-test
Angular uploader with ng-file-upload: "Lightweight Angular directive to upload files."

I had to make a file uploader with some of the Angular plugins. I took the design of the table from [here](http://www.bootply.com/JnOYtO9xzn) and made little changes. After some googling I did find [ng-file-upload](https://github.com/danialfarid/ng-file-upload) . The examples provided on the page have one common problem: if you choose second file during the uploading process it overrides the previous one or affects progress bar.

You can see the [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/Georgy/58oL5g4c/1/)
